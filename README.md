# DS241 F21 Portfolio

This portfolio showcases some of my work during DS241 (Introduction to Data Science).

## Files Included

- covid.rmd: Compute and plot deaths per day from COVID-19 for a certain list of states. This uses basic dyplr commands (such as filter and group_by), as well as an extensive ggplot output.
- ma132-enroll.rmd: Given enrollment data for Calculus I and II, this file predicts enrollment for Calculus II using Calculus I data from prior semesters. Ellaborate filtering and grouping is used here, along with data frame manipulations such as summarise_all.
- dennys.rmd: An extensive file that compares locations of Denny's to Laquinta's to see if Denny's is closer on average to Laquinta than other restaurants. Here, multiple functions are written to calculate distances, plots, etc. We also use a statistical test (namely, a t-test) to have our conclusions be more rigorous.

## Skills Included
- Reading in data files (csv, excel, geojson).
- Downloading real-time data using API's.
- Basic cleaning, including use of the janitor package.
- Dpylr functions, such as filter, mutate, group_by, select, summarise, and bind_rows.
- ggplot (geom_shape, geom_density, geom_point, and geom_line, for example) and linear regression.
