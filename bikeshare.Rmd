knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```
### Goal
Our team goal was to build a dataframe with neighborhoods and riders from each neighborhood, over the course of the month September 2021.

### Initialization
We make use of the following packages.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(ggmap)
```

Download the capitalshare file from their [website](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data). You should only have to do this once, and only if the data is not already there. Although, running again is not bad.

```{r, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/202109-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.zip"

download.file(url, destfile = here("data", "raw", "capitalshare.csv.zip"), mode = "wb")
unzip(here("data", "raw", "capitalshare.csv.zip"), exdir = here("data", "raw"))
```

Read in the capitalshare data.

```{r, message=FALSE}
capitalshare <- read_csv(here("data", "raw", "202109-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)

stations <- capitalshare %>%
  select(start_station_name, start_lat, start_lng) %>%
  distinct(start_station_name, .keep_all=TRUE)
```

Read in geojson file from the [DC Health Planning Neighborhoods](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/dc-health-planning-neighborhoods/explore?location=38.890598%2C-77.022347%2C12.61) data set from OpenDC, and do some cleaning.

```{r, message=FALSE}
neigh = st_read(here("data", "raw", "dc_neigh.geojson")) %>% 
  clean_names() %>%
  separate(name, into = c("code", "neigh")) %>%
  mutate(code=case_when(
    code == "N35" ~ "N0",
    TRUE ~ code
  )) %>%
  # remove the following columns as we don't need them
  select(-c(shapearea, shapelen, neigh)) %>%
  rename(neigh = dc_hpn_name)
```
### Data Cleaning

Compute riders per station (summarized across the month) and by member status (casual or member of capitalshare).

```{r, message=FALSE}
riders_day <- capitalshare %>%
  # extract the date only from started_at
  mutate(start_date = date(started_at)) %>%
  group_by(start_date, start_station_name, member_casual) %>%
  # sum the number of riders
  summarise(riders = n()) %>%
  # remove any NA values
  drop_na() %>%
  ungroup()

rides_by_station <- riders_day %>%
  group_by(start_station_name, member_casual) %>%
  summarise(riders = sum(riders))
```

Add coordinates of stations by joining.

```{r}
riders_day_loc <- left_join(rides_by_station, stations, by = "start_station_name")
```

Change to simple features (sf) format. This converts latitude and longitude coordinates to a geometrical format.

```{r}
riders_sf <- st_as_sf(riders_day_loc, coords = c("start_lng", "start_lat"), crs = 4326)
```

Join with neighborhood data so we know what neighborhood each station is in.

```{r}
stations_neigh <- st_join(riders_sf, neigh, join = st_intersects)
```

Remove unnecessary columns and clean things up.

```{r}
neigh_stats <- stations_neigh %>%
  select(-c(geometry)) %>%
  rename( station = start_station_name) 
```

We only want each neighborhood listed once (not twice), so we create new columns for each membership type (casual or member). 

```{r, message=FALSE}
rides_with_member <- neigh_stats %>%
  group_by(neigh, member_casual) %>%
  summarise(tot_riders = sum(riders))

final_df <- rides_with_member %>%
  # sum the riders based on casual or member
  mutate(
    riders_casual = case_when(member_casual == "casual" ~ tot_riders),
    riders_member = case_when(member_casual == "member" ~ tot_riders)
  ) %>%
  # now, condense the data frame vertically.
  group_by(neigh) %>%
  # the following step removes the NA values in the column by summarizing again and summing the riders.
  summarise(
    riders_casual = sum(riders_casual, na.rm = TRUE),
    riders_member = sum(riders_member, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>%
  # add a column for total riders
  mutate(
    tot_riders = riders_casual + riders_member
  )
```

### Results
Let's check the result. 

```{r}
tail(final_df)
```
Note that the last row contains NA for the neighborhood. We believe this corresponds to stations that could not be categorized into a neighborhood, which could be a fault in the neighborhood data we have. This is something that should be considered during the analysis step as there could be neighborhoods that are not accurately represented in the data here.
